# Installation

## Main Dependency

you have to install [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dhiwise/tailwind-merge) and configure it yourself.

## Configuration

Every PSWUI component uses `shared.tsx` core utility file. So, you have to care about import of `shared.tsx`.

All component file uses `../shared.tsx` to import `shared.tsx`.
You can simply put `shared.tsx` at the same level as component folder, but you can also change import path to yours.

## CLI

Now, we have our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@psw-ui/cli) to automatically install component and shared core utility.

You can simply type this:

```shell
$ [packageManager] install @psw-ui/cli

$ pswui [COMMAND] ...
```

### `pswui list`

`List` command prints the component registry, so you can check available or installed components.

### `pswui add`

`Add` command install component provided to your project.

It adds:
* `shared.tsx` core utility
* `[component].tsx` component file

You can configure the installation path and import path by configuration file.

### Configuration

#### Naming

Basically, name of config file can be one of this:
* `pswui.config.js`
* `pswui.config.mjs`
* `pswui.config.cjs`

CLI takes default export, so you should make it export as default.

If you want to make CLi to take different config file, you can provide the configuration file name via flag:

```shell
$ pswui [COMMAND] -p pswui-config.js
$ pswui [COMMAND] --config=pswui-config.js
```

#### Type

There is export of `Config` type and `buildConfig` function in `@psw-ui/cli`.

You can leverage your IDE's intellisense with those.

```ts
import { Config } from "@psw-ui/cli"

const config: Config = {
  /* ... */
}

export default config
```

```ts
import { buildConfig } from "@psw-ui/cli"

export default buildConfig({
  /* ... */
})
```
